# Social-Network-API

https://github.com/dcho10/Social-Network-API

## Description

  
The purpose of my app is to: Build an API for a social network that will allow users to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete) with regards users, their thoughts and reactions.
  
The app is intended for: Users who would like to potentially try out a new social networking platform
  
The reason I created the app is: Provide an alternative to the major social networking platforms (Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, etc.)
  
Some victories I experienced include: Connecting to MongoDB
  
Some challenges I experienced include: Getting the CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality to work

## Installation

  You will need to install the following dependencies:

  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.17.1",
    "mongoose": "^8.0.0"
    },

## Usage

  To install the npms, the user has two ways of doing so:

  * Create a package.json file, and copy and paste the dependcies above. Create a server.js file, right-click on the file and click on "Open in Integrated Terminal." Once it is opened, you enter npm i or npm install in the terminal and it will install both npms for you.

  * Create a server.js file, right-click on the file and install each npm individually (i.e. npm i express@4.17.1) until both packages are installed.
